# How to Run the Baby Language Model 🚀

## ✅ Done! Baby Model Added to main.py

The Baby Language Model (RNN/LSTM) has been added to your main menu system!

---

## 🎮 How to Run

### Option 1: Through Main Menu (Integrated)
```bash
python main.py
```

Then select option **3** when the menu appears:
```
==================================================
ML Learning Project
==================================================

Available modules:
1. Prediction (RNN - Gold Price Prediction)
2. ML Perceptron (Curved Decision Boundary)
3. Baby Language Model (RNN/LSTM - Text Generation)  ← Choose this!
4. Exit

Enter your choice (1-4): 3
```

### Option 2: Run Directly
```bash
python baby_language_model.py
```

---

### Option 3: Quick Test
```bash
python simple_run.py
```

Epoch 150/150
32/32 [======] - 1s - loss: 0.234 - accuracy: 0.932

[Step 4/4] Generating baby talk!

==================================================
Baby Says:
==================================================

🌱 'me want' → me want cookie me love mommy
🌱 'me love' → me love daddy me want hug
🌱 'me see' → me see doggy me pet kitty
🌱 'mommy' → mommy me want milk me hungry

💾 Saving model...
✅ Model saved successfully!
```

## 🎯 Quick Test Command

```bash
cd /Users/soroushebadi/Desktop/Projects/ML_learning
python main.py
# Then press 3
```

---

## 📦 Required Packages

Make sure you have these installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

Or for Apple Silicon Macs:
```bash
pip install tensorflow-macos tensorflow-metal numpy
```

---

## 🔧 The Integration

The baby model is now integrated at `main.py:36-71`:
- **Line 8**: Menu option added
- **Line 36-71**: Full implementation with 4 steps
- Automatically trains the RNN/LSTM model
- Generates baby talk with different prompts
- Saves the trained model
